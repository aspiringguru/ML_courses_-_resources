# Quick list of Machine Learning courses and resources.
## contributions welcome.

Some leaders in the Machine Learning field you should follow.

A short list of MOOC's I've found useful. Coursera and Edx offer specialisations which I like for their structured approach.

Machine Learning is dependent on a good understanding of statistics. I was rusty and did some brush up with these courses and resources.




John Hopkins University offers a very good specialization in Machine Learning - this was my first serious course in Machine Learning. It's taught in R. I've since migrated to python. The concepts are the same and while I'm likely to be focussing on python, the knowledge of R is valuable. There are several elements in this specialisation I've not seen taught in other courses, the reproducible research concept is extremely valuable, IMHO more clients should demand this element be incorporated into implementation.

Yes, it's a big specialization. Covers a lot of material, not just machine learning coding. The data clearning, exploratory analysis sections are very useful for generla data scientist skills.


* The University of Washington offers a very good specialization (four courses). I like this for it's exploration of the algorithms and requiring students to implement methods. https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning

Some courses I'm still to do and reccomended by notable ML leaders.
